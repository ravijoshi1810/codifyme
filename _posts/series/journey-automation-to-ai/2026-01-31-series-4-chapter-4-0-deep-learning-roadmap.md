## Why This Chapter Exists

When I first heard about deep learning, it sounded like magic—neural networks, layers, CNNs, RNNs, transformers. But it was hard to see how all the pieces fit together, or why each mattered.

Series 4 is about building your intuition for deep learning, one core idea at a time. Think of it as learning the essential patterns and architectures—so you can understand, compare, and use them in real projects.

This chapter is your roadmap: a quick bridge connecting the big ideas, and showing how each chapter in Series 4 fits into the bigger picture.

**How to use this chapter:**  
Use this as a reference as you work through Series 4. Each section previews a key concept and points you to the chapter where you’ll master it. If you get lost, come back here for the big picture.
