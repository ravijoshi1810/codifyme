## From Automation to AI – A Practitioner’s Journey

This series documents my journey of learning **Artificial Intelligence from the perspective of a Solution Architect** working on:

- Automation frameworks  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform / Ansible)  
- DevOps and CI/CD platforms  
- Cloud Management Platforms (CMPs) and self-service catalogs  

The goal is **not** to become a data scientist.

The goal is to understand:
- Where AI fits in modern architectures  
- How AI complements automation and IaC  
- How to design, integrate, and govern AI-enabled platforms  

This is a **learning journal** and a **practical reference**—written for my future self and for engineers walking a similar path.

## Who This Series Is For

This series is intended for:

- Solution architects
- Automation and platform engineers
- DevOps and IaC practitioners
- Engineers building self-service or CMP platforms

If you already work with:
- Pipelines
- Desired state
- Guardrails
- Scale and governance  

You are the intended audience.

## How to Read This Series

You can:

- Read sequentially from Series 0 onward
- Jump directly to a topic of interest
- Use it as a reference when designing platforms

Each chapter is written to stand on its own, while still fitting into the larger journey.

## Closing Note

This series is intentionally:

- Architecture-focused
- Concept-first
- Tool-agnostic

**Think of it as:** AI explained for people who already build automation platforms.
