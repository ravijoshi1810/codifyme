# 🔰 Getting Started with Terraform Import

In the previous post **<a href="{{ 'series/terraform-import-and-refactoring/1-intro-terraform-import-refactoring/' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">🛠️ Introduction to Terraform Import and Refactoring</a>**, we discussed the importance of Terraform Import in managing existing cloud resources and the need for refactoring Terraform code for better scalability. We also introduced the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its significance in modern cloud operations.

This foundation sets the stage for our next step: diving into the **🚦 Getting Started with Terraform Import**.

Before diving into the details of Terraform Import and refactoring, let's take a closer look at the **🏢 ABC Corp environment** to understand why importing and refactoring resources is necessary.

## 🏢 ABC Corp’s IaC Evolution: Bringing Infrastructure Under Control

**Scenario Overview**:

ABC Corp has multiple environments (production and development), and their infrastructure is managed using Terraform. However, during their ongoing migration from on-premises systems to the cloud, certain resources were created manually or via the cloud console, outside of Terraform’s management. This creates the need to bring those resources under Terraform’s control to ensure they are properly managed going forward.

**Infrastructure Overview**:

-   **Platform**: Terraform Cloud (or CLI for local management).
-   **Environments**: Two environments, **prod** and **dev**, each with dedicated Terraform workspaces (`prod-abc-app`, `dev-abc-app`).
-   **Repositories**:
    -   **Root Module Repositories**: Contain environment-specific Terraform configurations.
    -   **Module Repository**: Hosts reusable modules for AWS services (e.g., EC2, RDS, VPC).

**Day 1 Provisioning**: Infrastructure is provisioned through a GitOps workflow, using Terraform to ensure automated deployments.

###   Current State of Operations

-   **Day 2 Operations**:
    -   Performed manually or through "click ops" (cloud console/CLI).
    -   Resources created during ongoing on-premises migration are **not tracked** in Terraform.
-   **Challenges**:
    -   **Drift**: Manual changes lead to discrepancies between the live environment and Terraform state.
    -   **Risk of Impact**: Teams avoid modifying Terraform configurations to prevent production issues.
    -   **Stale Configurations**: Terraform codebases and workspaces are outdated, no longer reflecting the current infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Import Flow - Way Forward

The following workflow outlines how ABC Corp systematically approached the import process to align their resources with Terraform, integrating automation and GitOps principles to maintain efficiency and reliability.

![terraform_import_workflow](images/terraform_import_workflow.gif)

The workflow operates across four layers:

1.  **☁️ Cloud**: Read-only credentials fetch resource details from providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
2.  **💻 Local Machine**: Scripts or tools generate import blocks, initialize Terraform, and create HCL configurations. The process includes validation and cleanup until successful.
3.  **<0xF0><0x9F><0x93><0x84> Git**: Validated configurations are pushed to a repository. Pull requests are reviewed, fixes applied, and import tags added.
4.  **🚀 Terraform Enterprise/CLI**: Terraform jobs are triggered to plan and apply changes, ensuring resources are fully imported and managed by IaC.

### ⚙️ Prerequisites and Setup

Before using Terraform Import, ensure you have the following prerequisites and setup:

### 🔑 1. AWS Account Setup

1.  ✅ Ensure you have an active AWS account.
2.  🔑 Create Access Keys:
    -   ➡️ Go to **IAM > Users** in the AWS Console.
    -   ➡️ Select your user, navigate to **Security Credentials**, and generate an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.
3.  ⚙️ Configure AWS CLI:

    ```bash
    aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [****************4NXU]:
    AWS Secret Access Key [****************bfsD]:
    Default region name [eu-west-1]:
    Default output format [None]:
    ```

    or use the following command to set up your AWS credentials and default region.

    ```bash
    vi ~/.aws/config
    ```

    ![Terraform Cloud Workspace](images/post2_terraform_cloud_workspace.png)

    **Provide**:

    -   🔑 AWS Access Key ID
    -   🔑 AWS Secret Access Key
    -   📍 Default Region (e.g., us-east-1)
    -   📄 Output Format (default: json)

    **Verify Setup**:

    ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```

    This command should return your AWS account ID and ARN, confirming that your AWS CLI is correctly configured.

    ```bash
    {
        "UserId": "AROA4KOIXDFR4BRNJ56H5:EXAMPLE",
        "Account": "3123456789012",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::3123456789012:assumed-role/ExampleRole/EXAMPLE"
    }
    ```

### 💻 2. Install Visual Studio Code

-   ⬇️ Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 📂 6. Git Repository Setup

-   📂 Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

-   🌿 Use Git to manage Terraform configurations.

### ☁️ 7. Workspace Setup

Using Terraform Cloud:

1.  ☁️ Log in to Terraform Cloud.
2.  🛠️ Create a new Workspace:
    -   🏷️ Name the workspace based on your environment (e.g., prod-app-xyz).
    -   🔗 Link your Git repository to the workspace for automated plan and apply workflows (valid only if using VCS-driven workflow).

    ![Terraform Cloud Workspace](images/post2_terraform_cloud_workspace.png)

3.  ⚙️ Configure `main.tf` with the remote backend:

    ```hcl
    terraform {
        backend "remote" {
            organization = "your-org-name"

            workspaces {
                name = "your-workspace-name"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### 📦 7.1 Backend Configuration (Optional)

If using a remote backend like S3, configure `main.tf` as follows:

```hcl
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket          = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
        key             = "path/to/your/statefile"
        region          = "us-west-2"
        dynamodb_table  = "terraform-lock-table"
    }
}
```
### 🔍 8. Validate the configuration for all the installed tools and libraries:
```bash
terraform --version
aws --version
python --version
pip3 --version
pip show boto3
pip show loguru

# AWS configure to connect with AWS account
aws configure list
```
