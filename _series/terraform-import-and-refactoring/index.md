# Terraform Import and Refactoring: A Practical Guide to IaC-Managed Cloud Services and Operations

## 1. Introduction to Terraform Import and Refactoring

### Overview
Terraform is one of the most popular tools for managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC). However, managing pre-existing cloud resources can be challenging when they are not initially provisioned by Terraform. This is where the **`terraform import` command** becomes invaluable.

In this series, we will explore:
- The role of Terraform Import in hybrid cloud management.
- Why refactoring Terraform code is crucial for scalability.
- The challenges and benefits of adopting these practices.

### What You’ll Learn
By the end of this series, you’ll:
1. Understand how to import existing resources into Terraform.
2. Learn best practices for refactoring Terraform configurations.
3. Apply these techniques to real-world scenarios.


### Who Should Read This
This series is ideal for:
- Cloud engineers looking to bring existing resources under Terraform management.
- Developers who want to improve their Terraform project structure.
- Teams transitioning to IaC workflows with GitOps principles.
